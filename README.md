## Introduction

This is a repository of resources that have been collected by members of the
[Learn Armenian](https://discord.gg/xwgAysRrZU) community on Discord pertaining
to the Armenian language in all of its forms.

'Armenian' is a collective name for a group of closely related dialects, chiefly
the Eastern and Western Armenian variants, but also historical variants such as
Classical and Middle Armenian. Instead of focusing on a single, particular
dialect, this repository seeks to house resources for all of the variants of the
Armenian language.

Anybody and everybody is welcome to contribute to this repository, as well as
urged to create one for their native or target language if one does not exist.
